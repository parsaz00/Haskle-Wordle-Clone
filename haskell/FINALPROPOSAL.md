# Guide to MVP + Learning done

"Parsa + Daichi"

One of the main things our group had to learn to be able to build out our MVP was to learn how to create a GUI in Haskell. This was a challenging undertaking, but we had a lot of fun (and a bit of stress) creating it. As we know, Haskeell is a functional language, meaning it emphasizes immutability and pure functions, which in turn means that functions have no side effects. This obivously presents a challenge, because a GUI is the "king" of side effects. Furthermore, Haskell doesn't have a mainstream or well agreed upon native GUI framework built into its ecosystem. So we had to learn and rely on the GTK+3 toolkit to be able to build out the GUI. By using the `gtk3` library, we were able to leverage its framework for GUI creation, as it provides Haskell bindings to GTK+3, allowing us to access its widgets and event-driven programming model. 

Parsa + Daichi overall learning + contribution learning had to MVP:

One of the essential parts in making our MVP work was being able to handle side effects using the IO monad, as we had to make a GUI. GUI development is imperative and side-effect driven, but the functional paradigm of Haskell required us to encapsulate these side effects carefully, ensuring that our program maintained a clear and predictable flow of operations. This is clear in our hierarchical GUI design, where we created layouts, widgets, and event handlers in a logical sequence, leveraging **monadic flow** to manage the dependencies between these actions. We also learned how to use the GKT+3 toolking through the gtk3 library to create and structure our GUI. From understanding layout management with containers like VBox and Grid to dynamically populating widgets like labels and buttons, we experienced firsthand the power of functional abstractions for declarative GUI construction. It was especially fun to use higher-order functions such as zipWithM_ to programmatically populate grids: this deepened our appreciation for Haskell's ability to elegantly manage complex iterations with conscise and expressive code. State management with IORef was another critical learning area. GUIs often require mutable state, such as tracking the current row of guesses or the number of remaining hints. By using IORef, we were able to maintain and update this state functionally while preserving the overall purity of our program. Additionally, integrating event-driven programming using constructs like on ... buttonActivated taught us how to attach interactivity to our GUI and handle user inputs dynamically.

## Code snippets and associated learning for the GUI
```
-- Main function to launch the GUI
launchGUI :: String -> String -> IO ()
launchGUI targetWord difficulty = do
  -- Initialize GTK
  initGUI

  -- Create the main window
  window <- windowNew
  set window [windowTitle := "Wordle Game", windowDefaultWidth := 400, windowDefaultHeight := 600]
```

  https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/parsaz00/cpsc-312-project/blob/6ac6833e59d534a69001f8a0cafb7d51132e451c/haskell/src/GUI.hs#L9C1-L17C99

  Here, we start with initializng the library with initGUI. Since we are working with a GUI (which will have many side effects) we need all the the GUI actions to be side effects, which makes the use of IO monads perfect, so that we can handle all the side effects appropriately. Furthermore, the way our GUI works is almost hierarchical in terms of creating the different aspects of it. Since the GUI requires specific sequences of operations (ex: creating a window, then adding a button, then showing the window), the Monad and its natural handling of this flow of operations was perfect. Using online tools like the documentation for gtk3 and chatGPT, we were able to figure out how to initialize our GUI. Finally, set window [windowTitle := "Wordle Game", windowDefaultWidth := 400, windowDefaultHeight := 600] is used to actually set the properties of our GUI window, including the title and the dimensions. 

```
-- Create a vertical box layout
vbox <- vBoxNew False 10
containerAdd window vbox
```

```
-- Create a grid for displaying guesses
grid <- tableNew 6 7 True
boxPackStart vbox grid PackGrow 0
```

https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/parsaz00/cpsc-312-project/blob/6ac6833e59d534a69001f8a0cafb7d51132e451c/haskell/src/GUI.hs#L19C3-L25C36

Here, we began actually populating our GUI window. vBoxNew False 10 creates a vertical box layout, which is a container that arranges child widgets in a vertical line below each other. The first argument False is so that the widgets retain their true size and are not set to be equally distributed. 10 is the spacing in pixels that we want between the child widget. We had to play around with this and get advice from ChatGPT until it looked right. 
containerAdd window vbox adds the vertical box we just made to the window 

```
grid <- tableNew 6 7 True
```

We create a grid with 6 rows and 7 columns. By using True, we indicate that the rows and columns should ALL have the same size.

```
boxPackStart vbox grid PackGrow 0
```

We add the grid to the vbox. PackGrow allows the vbox to expand the grid and fill any extra space if the window is resized . 0 means no extra padding around the grid 

Overall, by this point, we actually began to apprecaite the inherent flow of operations that the Haskell monad operates in. The way we are building the GUI up comes really naturally , because it has a logical flow to it. We are declaring a layout: Add X to the vbox, and the vbox to the window etc. 

```
-- Create a 6x7 grid of label widgets initialized with "_"
labels <- mapM (mapM (\_ -> labelNew (Just "_"))) (replicate 6 (replicate 7 ()))

-- Attach each label to its corresponding position in the grid
zipWithM_ (\row rowWidgets ->
    zipWithM_ (\col widget ->
        tableAttachDefaults grid widget col (col+1) row (row+1))
    [0..] rowWidgets)
    [0..] labels
```
https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/parsaz00/cpsc-312-project/blob/6ac6833e59d534a69001f8a0cafb7d51132e451c/haskell/src/GUI.hs#L27C2-L33C19

```
labels <- mapM (mapM (\_ -> labelNew (Just "_"))) (replicate 6 (replicate 7 ()))
```

replicate 6 (replicate 7 ()): this creates a list of lists filled with (). This will be placeholders for the rows and columns 


(\_ -> labelNew (Just "_")): this creates a new GTK label widget, which we initialize with ‚Äú_‚Äù
These are empty placeholders in the grid, where the guesses will ultimately appears

```
mapM (mapM ...):
```

The first mapM applies a monadic action to each row in the list, meaning we fill each row in the grid with (‚Äú_‚Äù)
The second map applies the same action to every placeholder in a row
zipWithM_ is like zipWith, but the monadic version of it. It performs the same pairwise combination, but allows side effects (in this case updating our gui) since it operates in a monad . We use them like a nested loop. The outer zipWithM_ iterates over the rows and then inner zipWithM_ iterates over columns within a row
```
zipWithM_ (\row rowWidgets ...) [0..] labels
```

Labels is our 6x7 grid of widgets [0..] are the indices 

With this we iterate over each row index (row) and its corresponding row of widgets (rowWidgets)
```
zipWithM_ (\col widget ...) [0..] rowWidgets
```

For each row of widgets, in the inner lop we iterate over the columns indices (col) and process each widget in that row ‚Üí we attach the widget to grid at position (row, col)

```
tableAttachDefaults grid widget col (col+1) row (row+1)
```

This actually places the widget in the grid at the specific row and column. grid is the grid container. Widget is the label we want to attach. Finally, col,col+1,row,row+1 are the starting and ending column and row indices respectively. 


```
-- Add a text entry for guesses
input <- entryNew
boxPackStart vbox input PackNatural 10

-- Add a submit button
submitButton <- buttonNewWithLabel "Submit"
boxPackStart vbox submitButton PackNatural 10

-- Add a hint button
hintButton <- buttonNewWithLabel "Hint"
boxPackStart vbox hintButton PackNatural 1
```
https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/parsaz00/cpsc-312-project/blob/6ac6833e59d534a69001f8a0cafb7d51132e451c/haskell/src/GUI.hs#L35C3-L45C46

Overall, we are adding interactive elements to the GUI here. We create a text input widget where users will be able to enter their text, and then we add it to our vertical box. We also create a button labeled "Submit" and add it to the vertical box. Finally, we create a Hint button, which we add to the vertical box. This is the button users will press if they want to get a hint. 


```
legendBox <- hBoxNew False 10
boxPackStart vbox legendBox PackNatural 10

greenLegend <- labelNew (Just "üü© Correct letter & position")
yellowLegend <- labelNew (Just "üü® Correct letter, wrong position")
grayLegend <- labelNew (Just "‚¨ú Incorrect letter")

boxPackStart legendBox greenLegend PackNatural 5
boxPackStart legendBox yellowLegend PackNatural 5
boxPackStart legendBox grayLegend PackNatural 5
```

Here, we are simply populating our GUI window with a legend that will tell users what the feedback they recieve from their guess actually means. 

```
-- Handle submit button click
  on submitButton buttonActivated $ do
    guess <- entryGetText input
    row <- readIORef currentRow
    if row >= length labels
      then labelSetText feedbackLabel "Game Over! You've used all your guesses."
      else if length guess /= length targetWord
        then labelSetText feedbackLabel $ "Guess must be " ++ show (length targetWord) ++ " letters long!"
        else do
          -- Get feedback from the game logic
          let feedback = checkGuess targetWord guess

          -- Update the grid with feedback
          zipWithM_ (\col char -> labelSetText (labels !! row !! col) [char]) [0..length targetWord - 1] guess

          -- Show feedback using colored symbols (e.g., emojis)
          zipWithM_ (\col char -> do
            let label = labels !! row !! col
            case char of
              '@' -> labelSetText label "üü©"  -- Green square
              'O' -> labelSetText label "üü®"  -- Yellow square
              'X' -> labelSetText label "‚¨ú"  -- Gray square
            ) [0..length targetWord - 1] feedback

          -- Update feedback label
          if feedback == replicate (length targetWord) '@'
            then labelSetText feedbackLabel "Congratulations, you guessed the word!"
            else do
              labelSetText feedbackLabel "Try again!"
              modifyIORef currentRow (+1)
```

This is the core part of the program's interactivity. Here, we are processing user input and then updating the GUI in response to button clicks. 

```
on submitButton buttonActivated $ do
```

Here, we learned about attaching event listeners (similar to what we had done in 210 with our GUI's). Specifically here, we are attaching an event listener to the submitButton. buttonActivated specifies that the event type is a click of the button. Finally $do starts the block of actions that should be executed when the button is clicked. 

```
guess <- entryGetText input
```
Read the text entered in the input field and store it in guess for further processing.

```
row <- readIORef currentRow
``` 
Reads the current value of the mutable currentRow (the index of the grid row being updated)

```
	if row >= length labels
 		 then labelSetText feedbackLabel "Game Over! You've used all your guesses."
 else if length guess /= length targetWord
    			then labelSetText feedbackLabel $ "Guess must be " ++ show (length targetWord) ++ " letters long!"
```

If the user has already used all the rows (i.e., used up all their guesses) then the game is over. In the second part, if the guess length is not correct, we inform the user by updating the GUI with the feedbackLabel 

```
else do
  let feedback = checkGuess targetWord guess
```

This part is us calling the checkGuess function in GameLogic, which we developed for the POC

```
zipWithM_ (\col char -> labelSetText (labels !! row !! col) [char]) [0..] guess
```

Iterate through each column index (col) and corresponding letter (char) in the guess 

labels !! row !! col : this selects the label at the current row and column 
Finally, labelSetText updates the label to display the letter from the guess 

```
zipWithM_ (\col char -> case char of
  '@' -> labelSetText (labels !! row !! col) "üü©"
  'O' -> labelSetText (labels !! row !! col) "üü®"
  'X' -> labelSetText (labels !! row !! col) "‚¨ú"
  ) [0..] feedback
```

We iterate through the indices of feedback and update the grid according to the map with the correct color box emoji . We then call modifyIORef currentRow (+1). This updates the mutable value of currentRow by incrementing it. This ensures that the next guess will appear in the following row 

### Hint Button
```
on hintButton buttonActivated $ do
  hintsLeft <- readIORef remainingHints
  if hintsLeft <= 0
    then labelSetText feedbackLabel "No hints left!"
    else do
      randomIndex <- randomRIO (0, length targetWord - 1)
      let hint = "Hint: The letter at position " ++ show (randomIndex + 1) ++ " is '" ++ [targetWord !! randomIndex] ++ "'."
      labelSetText feedbackLabel hint
      modifyIORef remainingHints (\x -> x - 1)
```
The "Hint" button provides players with helpful hints during gameplay. When clicked, the button will check if there are any remaining hints available. If there are, a random letter from the target word is revealed, with its position in the word displayed to the player. If no hints are left, the player will be informed with the message "No hints left!".

The logic for this is handled in the following way:
1. Button Event Handling: The on hintButton buttonActivated event listens for when the player clicks the "Hint" button.
2. Hint Availability Check: The number of available hints is tracked using an IORef called remainingHints. If there are no hints left, a message is displayed to the player.
3. Generating and Displaying a Hint: If hints are available, a random index from the target word is selected, and the corresponding letter is displayed in the form of a hint.
4. Updating the Remaining Hints: Each time a hint is used, the number of remaining hints is decremented by one.
Here‚Äôs a simplified version of the relevant code:

### Retry Button
```
on retryButton buttonActivated $ do
  widgetDestroy window
  result <- generateNewTargetWord "/path/to/Words.txt"
  case result of
    Nothing -> putStrLn "Error: Words file could not be loaded or is empty."
    Just (newTargetWord, newDifficulty) -> launchGUI newTargetWord newDifficulty
```

The "Retry" button allows the player to start a new game by generating a new random target word and launching the GUI again. When the "Retry" button is clicked, a new word is selected from a file, and a new game session begins.

This is handled through the following steps:

1. Button Event Handling: The on retryButton buttonActivated event listens for the click of the "Retry" button.
2. Loading a New Word: The function generateNewTargetWord reads a file that contains a list of words, selects a random word, and returns it as the new target word for the game.
3. Launching the GUI: After obtaining a new word, the GUI is relaunched with the new target word and difficulty.

Throughout the implementation of the hint and retry functionality, several key Haskell concepts and skills were reinforced:

1. **File I/O:** The generateNewTargetWord function demonstrates how to read a file and process its content. Using readFile to load data and map to transform it into a usable list is a common pattern for handling external data in Haskell.
2. **Randomization**: Using randomRIO to generate random indices from a list shows how randomness can be incorporated into a program. This is useful for any functionality where unpredictability or variety is required.
3. **Event Handling in GUIs**: Implementing event handlers for button clicks (buttonActivated) using on shows how Haskell can be used for interactive GUI applications. These handlers allow us to define the logic of the program when the user interacts with the interface.
4. **State Management with IORe**f: The use of IORef to store and modify mutable state, like the number of remaining hints, is a key Haskell concept for managing side effects. In this case, it tracks the number of hints left throughout the game.
5. **Modifying State**: Using modifyIORef to update the value of remainingHints is an important skill for mutating state in Haskell, as it combines functional programming principles with IO-based side effects.
6. **Pattern Matching**: The generateNewTargetWord function also reinforces the importance of pattern matching in Haskell, especially when handling cases like Nothing and Just for the result of the random word generation.
