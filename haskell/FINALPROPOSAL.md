# Haskle: Final Proposal


# Guide to MVP + Learning done

"Parsa + Daichi"

One of the main things our group had to learn to be able to build out our MVP was to learn how to create a GUI in Haskell. This was a challenging undertaking, but we had a lot of fun (and a bit of stress) creating it. As we know, Haskeell is a functional language, meaning it emphasizes immutability and pure functions, which in turn means that functions have no side effects. This obivously presents a challenge, because a GUI is the "king" of side effects. Furthermore, Haskell doesn't have a mainstream or well agreed upon native GUI framework built into its ecosystem. So we had to learn and rely on the GTK+3 toolkit to be able to build out the GUI. By using the `gtk3` library, we were able to leverage its framework for GUI creation, as it provides Haskell bindings to GTK+3, allowing us to access its widgets and event-driven programming model.
