We made a wordle clone in Haskell for our Functional and Logical programming class. Don't recommend building a GUI in Haskell but it was a fun challenge, especially when you consider the fact that a GUI is basically only side effects, which goes against what Haskell is for. Alas, it was fun and it works great, do be sure to check it out. 

Collaborated with Daichi Furukawa to create this. 99% of the commits are from our student accounts :) 


We also made a little prolog program for fun which you can find below:
